 Hi 👋, I'm Chhaya Halpati

I am a BCA 6th semester student from Indrashil University with a strong interest in full-stack web development. 
I enjoy building real-world web applications and learning modern technologies through hands-on projects.

I have practical experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, REST API development, and MongoDB. 
I have worked on multiple projects including CampusBazar (a Lost & Found web application), FireSurvival (a JavaScript-based game), 
and a Spotify-like music application which is currently in progress.

I am a hardworking and self-motivated learner with the ability to quickly understand new concepts and technologies. 
My goal is to gain real industry experience through an internship where I can contribute to projects, improve my technical skills, 
and grow as a full-stack developer.
